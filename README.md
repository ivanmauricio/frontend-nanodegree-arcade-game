===============================

-Player has to reach 150 points to win.
-Player moves with up, down, left and right arrow keys.
-Player has 4 lives and colliding with an enemy bug takes away a life and resets player position to beginning.
-Reaching the water gives player 10 points and collecting a gem gives you 5 points.
-Every 30 points player evolves and level goes up, this means that enemy bugs and gems get faster too.
-Game can be paused with 'p' key.
-Good luck!
