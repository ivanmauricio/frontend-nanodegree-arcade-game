How to Run Game

  * Game can also be played online at -
    http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ivanmauricio/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/blob/master/index.html

  * Enjoy!


How to play
-----------

  * Player has to reach 150 points to win.

  * Player moves with up, down, left and right arrow keys.

  * Player has 4 lives and colliding with an enemy bug takes away a life and resets player position to beginning.

  * Reaching the water gives player 10 points and collecting a gem gives you 5 points.

  * Every 30 points player evolves and level goes up, this means that enemy bugs and gems get faster too.

  * Game can be paused with 'p' key.

  * Good luck!
